# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js makes building React applications a breeze. Here's how I set up this blog.

## Why Next.js?

- **Static Site Generation**: Perfect for blogs
- **React**: Component-based architecture
- **Easy Deployment**: Works great with Vercel and GitHub Pages

## The Stack

This blog uses:

1. Next.js 16 with App Router
2. TypeScript for type safety
3. Tailwind CSS for styling
4. Markdown for content

## Conclusion

If you're thinking about starting a blog, Next.js is a solid choice!
